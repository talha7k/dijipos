## 🛠️ Key Improvements

1. **Performance**: Leveraging TanStack Query's built-in caching and background refetching
2. **Developer Experience**: Simplified hook implementations with less boilerplate code
3. **Reliability**: Built-in retry mechanisms and error handling
4. **Consistency**: Standardized query keys and patterns across the application
5. **Real-time Updates**: Better handling of real-time data synchronization

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `@tanstack/react-query` - Core TanStack Query library
- `@tanstack-query-firebase/react` - Firebase integration (Firestore hooks)
- `@tanstack/react-query-devtools` - Devtools for debugging queries

## 🧪 Testing

All migrated hooks have been tested to ensure they work correctly with the new implementation.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any remaining direct Firebase SDK calls
2. Optimize query configurations based on usage patterns
3. Implement more advanced caching strategies where appropriate
4. Add comprehensive error boundaries and fallback UIs
5. Monitor performance improvements in production

## 📊 Overall Progress

✅ **Completed**: 32/32 hooks from the migration table
⏱️ **In Progress**: 0 hooks
⏸️ **Pending**: 0 hooks
❌ **Blocked**: 0 hooks

The migration has been successfully completed, with all hooks from the original migration table now using the TanStack Query Firebase library.
